# Arduino_Inverter_module
This repository made for inveter power module with serial interface which is be easily controlled by Arduino module such as pro mini or ESP8266
There is many modules in market that could help to perform smart IOT home project but unfortunately  there is rare product that  can use to control AC motor devices which is find in many home devices or appliance 
I gather all opensource information that I could  find yet  from design article to schematic file  and this is  really helpful to find proper approach to Arduino inverter module   
Fortunately there is very good IBGT power IC module with its BLDC driver from well known companies such as Infineon and Fairchild which is currently use in many  ready-to-use invertor product , following is couple of ICs  mostly find in midsize HVAC invertor boards
Fairchild  FSBB20CH60F  Motion SPMÂ® 3 Series with FCM8201 3-Phase Sinusoidal Brushless DC Motor Controller  
Infineon  IRAMS06UP60A   with MC3PHAC Monolithic Intelligent Motor Controller
